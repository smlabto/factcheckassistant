## About 
The Social Media Lab's Fact Check Assistant is an AI-powered bot for simple fact checking. It was created as demo for the Social Media Lab’s 2023 Canadian #AI Misinformation Hackathon. The app uses OpenAI API capabilities for simple fact checking. Please be aware that OpenAI has very limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021. As a result, the API may occasionally generate incorrect information. 

The app is provided “as is” without any warranty of accuracy, reliability, completeness, efficiency, timeliness, or correct sequencing of such information or otherwise, either express or implied. Reliance on any information provided by this demo app is solely at your own risk. We suggest verifying information provided here by consulting additional sources.
