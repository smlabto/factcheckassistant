The Social Media Lab's Fact Check Assistant is an AI-powered bot for simple fact checking. It was created as a proof of concept for the Social Media Lab’s 2023 Canadian #AI Misinformation Hackathon. The app uses OpenAI API capabilities to facilitate simple fact checking. Please be aware that OpenAI has very limited knowledge of the world and events after 2021 and that while OpenAI has put safeguards in place, their system may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information and produce offensive or biased content.
